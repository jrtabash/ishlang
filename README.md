# ishlang
Ishlang is a fully parenthesized prefix notation programming language inspired by Lisp. Though it is inspired by Lisp, the language diverts considerably from Lisp.

The name Ishlang (ish-lang) is shorthand for "Lisp'ish programming language", and was chosen to pay homage to Lisp.

The language is still under development, but already supports a rich set of features, including branching, looping, functions, structs and lambdas.

More details about the language available in docs/specification.txt

## Example: Hello World Program
(println "Hello World")
