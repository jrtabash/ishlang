Unit Tests
----------
Run all:
  ishlang -t

Run one test:
  ishlang -t -n <test_name>

List all unit tests:
  ishlang -t -l

The option -v can be added to all above commands for verbose mode.

Test Runner Scenarios
---------------------
Run all scenarios in a given folder:
  run_tests.sh <ishlang_binary> <make_test_files_binary> <scenarios_folder>

Scenario files must have the extension .test, and should be divided into
two sections, a __CODE__ section and an __EXPECT__ section. Add ishlang
code to the __CODE__ section, and add exoected standard output to the
__EXPECT__ section. Several scenarios are provided in the src/test_scenarios folder.

Example scenario file (example.test)

__CODE__
(var x (+ 1 2))
(println 3)
